# Springboard-Projects
This is a collection of a few projects completed at Springboard
Projects are separated into 5 Categories: Security Assessment, Network Security, Application Security, Endpoint Security, and Compliance

**Security Assessment**

Project: I completed a project that prepared an organization for its annual security audit. 
The organization faced several security and operational challenges related to its toll road operations, web application, server infrastructure, remote access, and logging practices. 
My role was to evaluate and address these concerns to ensure a secure and efficient toll road management system. 
I conducted a vulnerability assessment of the website's security including:
1. Vulnerability to web application attacks
2. WebLogic server security. 
3. Patch management and configuration data protection.
4. Remote access security concerns, such as shared vendor accounts.
5. Verification of proper separation between PROD, DEV, and TEST environments.
6. Logging and monitoring, with emphasis on security event tracking, especially regarding vendor activities.

Project: I was tasked to create a software test plan, cases, and cycles for a new application that tracks the movement of company trucks through the United States. 
This application collected data including locations, speed, direction, and cargo. I presented documentation outlining the project requirements as outlined by the project objectives. 
Details about the project are provided here:  Project: Software Testing.

**Network Security**

Project: I presented a short research paper on the notable DDoS attack that targeted AWS in February 2020. 
This research reviewed the attack mechanism and preventative measures. Click Network-Based Cybersecurity Incident for details

Project: I conducted a project to implement access control solutions for cloud-based claims applications. 
A public cloud service provider hosts this application. 
I outlined roles, secure remote access, policies, encryption, logging and monitoring, federation, and resource permissions. 
Click  Cloud Security for details.

**Application Security**

Project: I researched and presented the newer concept of DevSecOps. 
This is the process of integrating security as part of the CI/CD workflow. 
Creating automated security testing scripts that include fuzzing is an integral part of secure application development. 
Click New DevSecOps Group for details. 

Project: As mentioned previously, I completed an assessment for a toll company that deployed a new application. 
I presented this Web Application Vulnerability Remediation documentation as a guide for vulnerabilities facing the companyâ€™s web application. 


**Endpoint Security**

Project: I was given a scenario involving a company that was in the process of integrating external systems. 
The company wanted to ensure that the new systems were hardened prior to integration. 
I completed system hardening guidelines for Windows Server 2019, Oracle Linux, and Windows 10 machines. 
Click System Hardening for project details. 

Project: I was given a project to provide a brief overview of whether extending Active Directory into Azure Cloud and creating desktop virtualization solutions can alleviate some of the network issues experienced by its customer service department. 
I presented  Desktop Virtualization detailing the critical concerns of stakeholders including the type of virtualization platform, 
the departments that will benefit from virtualization, the primary benefits to the company, and the potential pitfalls of virtualization.
